# Efficient Tricks and Tools for developer, Data Scientists and Statisticians

Why efficient? Because using the moderen data stack more efficiently will make your code more readable and run more efficiently.

The goal of this book is to spread the awareness of efficient ways to do:

- Using Git for version control.
- Support the gap between Statistical- and Machine Learning.
- Building mlops platform.

## What Should You Expect From This Book?

This book expects you to have some basic knowledge of Programming, statistic, probability and data science.

You should also expect bite-size code snippets for each section. This will allow you to obtain multiple pieces of knowledge in fewer than one minute. I included the link to the resources for every tools introduced in case you want to explore them further.
